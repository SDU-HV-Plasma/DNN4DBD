 # The Deep Neural Network for Dielectric Barrier Discharges

A fully connected multilayer BP network together with a universal hidden layer structure is developed to explore the discharge characteristics of one current pulse per half voltage cycle of atmospheric dielectric barrier discharges. The discharge characteristics such as current density, electron density, ion density, and electric field of atmospheric dielectric barrier discharges can be quickly predicted by means of the deep neural network. The computational results show that, for a given training set, the constructed deep neural network can describe the properties of atmospheric dielectric barrier discharges with almost the same accuracy as the fluid model. In addition, the computational efficiency of the deep neural network is much higher than that of the fluid model.
